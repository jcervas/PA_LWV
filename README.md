Introduction
============

[I]{.lettrine}n *League of Women Voters v. Pennsylvania*, decided
January 22, 2018 (henceforth abbreviated *LWV*), the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court offered a new and distinctive test for unconstitutional
partisan gerrymandering under which it found the state's congressional
districts to be a "severe and durable\" partisan gerrymander that
violated a long-standing provision of the state's constitution. The
congressional map that was struck down was drawn in 2011 by a
Republican-controlled legislature and signed into law by the then
Republican governor. It was used in elections from 2012 to 2016. Prior
to the *LWV* decision, many academics had identified this map as a
partisan gerrymander [see e.g., @Royden2017], with some even identifying
it as the most egregious congressional districting in the U.S.
[@Wang2016_SLR esp. Figure 3].[^2]

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that "the fact that the 2011 Plan
cannot, as a statistical matter, be a plan directed at complying with
traditional redistricting requirements is to establish that it violates
the Free and Equal Elections Clause\" \[of the Pennsylvania State
Constitution\] (slip op. at p.128, emphasis added).[^3] By *traditional*
principles (also sometime called *neutral* principles, or *good
government* principles), the Court meant drawing contiguous districts,
satisfying the *one person, one vote* standard, avoiding diluting the
voting strength of protected racial or ethnic minority groups,
minimizing unnecessary political sub-unit splits, and providing
reasonably compact districts.[^4] However, the Court also considered a
variety of other indicators involving the partisan aspects of the plan
in coming to the conclusion that the map created a "severe and durable\"
partisan gerrymander.[^5]

Having invalidated the *2011 Enacted* map, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court offered the State the opportunity to draw a remedy plan. The
Pennsylvania legislature failed to enact a lawful remedy plan of its own
due mostly to divided government that led to disagreement as to how to
proceed between the newly elected Democratic governor and the still
Republican-controlled legislature. Had such a plan been , the Court
would have reviewed its constitutionality. In the absence of a State
plan, the Court invited submissions of plans from the parties to the
lawsuit, as well as the intervenors, to submit remedy plans; and it
provided guidance as to the features of the plan in which it was most
interested. The Court Order in February 2018 inviting submissions of
feasible maps mentioned only good government criteria: minimizing the
number of county, township and municipality splits, and maximizing
district compactness under several different measures of compactness. It
made no mention of incumbent protection, nor voting rights act
protections, nor of protecting communities of interests, nor did it
mention political outcome projections.

While remedy plans were offered by Republican legislators from both
chambers (the *Joint legislative* plan) and by the Democratic Governor
(*Gov. Wolf*), as well as by others, the Court rejected all such plans.
Instead, the Court ordered into place for the 2018 election a map of its
own drawn for it by a court-appointed consultant. In a split decision,
the Court map was endorsed only by judges with Democratic affiliations,
though some of the disagreement on the Court had less to do with the map
than with the timing of its implementation.[^6] The initial ruling that
the 2011 plan was unconstitutional was sharply attacked by Republicans
as judicial overreach, and the map the court majority adopted was rather
viciously attacked by Republicans as simply a pro-Democratic gerrymander
under the guise of a court-drawn map.[^7] However, the U.S. Supreme
Court has declined reviewing either the state court opinion rejecting
the 2011 plan or the state court's chosen map -- presumably because
these decision are based entirely on state law.

In contrast to the *LWV* finding that the 2011 Pennsylvania
congressional map was unconstitutional under state law, a 2017 challenge
to the Pennsylvania congressional map under the Elections Clause of the
U.S. Constitution was rejected by a three judge federal court by a vote
of 2-1. Because the *LWV* decision mooted the federal litigation, the
federal challenge was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, a
2018 remand of a Wisconsin partisan gerrymandering case,*Gill v.
Whitford* has, to a limited extent, provided clues about the current
\[ca. May 2019\] state of federal partisan gerrymandering jurisprudence
than anything before it.[^8] In that remand decision (*Gill v. Whitford,
585 U.S. \_\_\_ (2018)*), the Supreme Court indicated that any standard
for partisan gerrymandering must be a challenge to individual districts
which demonstrates that the voters in the particular district have had
their votes either "packed\" or "cracked.\"

Districts that have been *packed* are those which have had voters from
one partisan leaning grouped together so as to waste votes of the group
because they win the district by an overwhelming majority, thus
preventing those excess votes from being used more efficiently in other
districts. Districts that have been *cracked* are ones where voters of
one partisan leaning have had their share of the district's voting
strength reduced so as to make it impossible (or unlikely) that members
of this group will be able to carry the district. The standard for
unconstitutional gerrymandering at the federal level -- if there is ever
is one -- can thus be expected to be very different from that offered by
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, since *LWV* relies on data about the
features and effects of the plan as a whole, while the US Supreme Court
appears to be insisting on a district-specific test of packing and
cracking.

We can identify five key features of the LWV ruling: (a) though some
districts might be particularly egregious, evidence of unconstitutional
gerrymandering can be found in a plan as a whole; (b) evidence of
purposeful discrimination was not necessary in order to find
unconstitutionality; (c) evidence of discriminatory partisan effects was
not necessary to show a violation; (d) evidence that a plan complied
with good government criteria is almost certainly not sufficient to rule
out a finding of unconstitutionality, even though a finding that a plan
failed to comply with such criteria was sufficient to invalidate the
plan; and (e) statistical evidence about the likelihood that observed
features of a plan could not be explained either by chance or by
electoral geography played a pivotal role in the decision.

Although only directly applicable in Pennsylvania, *LWV* is, we believe,
nonetheless the most important partisan gerrymandering case yet decided
in a final and definitive fashion this decade.[^9] Language virtually
identical to the provision of the state constitution that the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court relied on is found in the constitutions of
another dozen states, and another ten have very similar language .[^10]
That language could be readily adapted to control gerrymandering in
those states in much the same way as did the Pennsylvania court. In
fact, in its opinion, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court offers what we read
as direct encouragement to state courts in other states to follow the
lead of Pennsylvania in crafting a way to overturn partisan
gerrymandering as a violation of a state constitution.[^11]

If other states courts do follow the Pennsylvania Supreme Court lead, we
view the expected effects on limiting partisan gerrymandering in those
states to be potentially greater than we might expect under federal law,
since they would involve the overturning of whole plans, not just
individual districts -- although, in practice, a finding of overall
unconstitutionality is likely to lead to changes only in the most
egregiously gerrymandered districts and some of the districts adjacent
to them. Unlike all federal courts that have ruled on partisan
gerrymandering to date, the Pennsylvania opinion does not require proof
of intent to discriminate, which could make proving a violation easier
under state law than under any likely federal standard. However,
although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinion does not require
evidence of partisan effects, and emphasizes failure to comply with good
government criteria, we believe that the *LWV* opinion can be "tweaked\"
to address what @GrofmanCervas2018_WashPo refer to as *stealth
gerrymanders*, i.e., plans that satisfy good government redistricting
criteria to a reasonable degree but are nonetheless carefully crafted
invidious partisan gerrymanders in terms of their expected political
impact. The reason for our optimism in this respect are the findings in
the opinion that do address partisan effects of the Pennsylvania
congressional map. In the concluding discussion of the paper we will
return to the question of the potential long run impact of this
Pennsylvania case.

In the remainder of this essay we will not seek to review in any more
detail the various legal and expert witness issues raised in the
Pennsylvania litigation itself.[^12] Rather, our primary aim is the
straightforward one of comparing and contrasting the 2011 and 2018
Pennsylvania congressional maps in terms of a variety of proposed
metrics for detecting partisan gerrymandering. In particular, we examine
the evidence for the claim that the 2011 map was a pro-Republican
gerrymander, and the claim that the 2018 map was a pro-Democratic
gerrymander. The former claim is one virtually universally acknowledged
[@Fang2014; @Mcgann_et_al_2015_ELJ; @McGann_et_al_2016_gerrymandering; @Wang2016_SLR; @Wang2016_ELJ],
while the latter claim has been offered not only as partisan griping by
Republicans on the losing side of the litigation, but by at least one
independent journalist.[^13] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has
declined reviewing either the state court opinion rejecting the 2011
plan or the state court's chosen map -- presumably because these
decision are based entirely on state law.

In addition to the actual 2011 and 2018 maps, we also address the
partisan and other features of two maps offered to the Pennsylvania
Court as a proposed remedy for constitutional violation found in the
2011 map: the *Joint Plan* offered by Republican legislators from both
chambers, and the congressional map proposed by the Democratic governor
(*Gov. Wolf*). Here we focus on the question of whether either of these
plans was a *stealth gerrymander* done to aid the party drawing the map.

Evaluating the Various Plans -- Methods and Theory
==================================================

As noted above, to contrast the Court-ordered Remedial plan with the
2011 Enacted plan, and to make further comparisons to the two most
politically important remedy plans offered to the Court, the Joint Plan
proposed by the Republicans leaders of the two legislative chambers, and
the Governor's proposed plan as a Democratic alternative, we will look
at a number of features of each of these four plans as a whole. We do
not discuss district-specific criteria for identifying gerrymandering in
these maps, since, although some district-specific evidence was
presented about the 2011 map in the trial testimony by an expert who was
highly knowledgeable about communities of interest in the state, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinion itself offers a statewide standard
for a finding of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering.[^14]
Consequently, we limit ourselves to metrics that report results for a
jurisdiction as whole.

We begin our analyses describing map features distinct from projected
(or actual) partisan outcomes or proposed measures of partisan effects.
Table [\[tab:summaries\]](#tab:summaries){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:summaries"} offers a comparison of key good government
features of the map.

-   the number of county splits, since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
		specifically sought to limit the number of counties spanning
		multiple districts;

-   two standard measures of compactness, since compactness is also a
		criterion specifically referenced by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court;

All the plans create contiguous districts. Similarly, all four plans
appear to satisfy voting rights requirements. In the interest of
contrasting the plans, we include only criteria with measurable
variation in Table FIX!.

Measurement and Data {#measurement-and-data .unnumbered .unnumbered}
--------------------

### County Splits {#county-splits .unnumbered .unnumbered}

There are a total of 67 counties in PA, and the state is allocated 18
congressional districts. Some county splits are necessitated by the size
of the county population relative to the ideal population of a
congressional district (705,687). Allegheny and Montgomery must each be
split at least twice, while Philadelphia must be split at least three
times. If no set of counties exactly equals the ideal congressional
population,[^15] every districting plan requires a minimum of n-1 splits
(where n equals the number of congressional districts. The Pennsylvania
Supreme Court found that an unusually and egregiously large number of
counties were split in the 2011 congressional map, and they found this
fact deeply troubling. Avoiding county splits is incorporated into the
language of many state constitutions [@Grofman1985] and can be seen as a
way of guarding against gerrymandering by making it more difficult to
draw partisan maps.

	: County Splits, Compactness Scores Of The Plans, And Projected
	Outcomes Using Elections In 2008 And 2016[]{label="tab:summaries"}

\tabnotes{County splits include all the pieces in which a county is split, not just the total number of counties that have been split. (The latter number is the one most often reported in both court documents and in the media, but we regard the measure we report as both more precise and more informative.)}
The data provided in Table
[\[tab:summaries\]](#tab:summaries){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:summaries"} shows how the high number of county splits in
the 2011 map was completely unnecessary. Both the Republican and
Democrat proposed remedy plans cut the number of county splits from 41
to 19. The Court plan goes even further, and gets the number of split
counties down to 17.

Which counties get split and how many ways can impact a plans outcome,
which can affect both national politics and a counties relationship with
the federal government [@Ansolabehere2002a]. That the 2011 map is an
eyesore vis-a-vis unnecessary splits of county boundaries is revealed
clearly in Figure [\[fig:maps\]](#fig:maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:maps"}.[^16]

### Compactness {#compactness .unnumbered .unnumbered}

The measurement of compactness has long been a central issue in the
districting literature [see e.g.,
@Reock1961; @Niemi1990; @Polsby1991; @Webster2013; @Kaufman2018]. Some
minimal level of compactness can make it harder to gerrymander
[@Reock1961; @Altman1998 cf. @Webster2013]. Indeed, the original
gerrymander was assumed to be so because of it irregular shape
[@Martis2008].

Moreover, compactness, as many authors have shown, has multiple
dimensions, and these different dimensions need not move in parallel
with one another; a plan can appears compact on one dimension might
appear ill-compact on another. The two most common ideas of compactness
refer, on the one hand, to how close a legislative district's boundaries
are to its geographic center and, on the other, to how "regular\" in
shape a district appears to be [@Kaufman2018]. In Table
[\[tab:summaries\]](#tab:summaries){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:summaries"} we report two well-known measures which tap
respectively each of these two dimensions. The *Polsby-Popper* measure
looks at perimeter irregularity by examining the area of the district
compared to that of a circle with similar perimeter, while the *Reock*
measure compares the area of a district with that of the district's
circumscribing circle [@Reock1961; @Polsby1991].[^17]

The 2011 Enacted map looks awful by both compactness measures compared
to the Court-ordered map, or even compared to the two proposed remedial
maps; while both the Republican and the Democratic proposed remedial
maps look reasonable by both compactness measures, even though the
Democratic plan is superior to the Republican plan and the court-ordered
map is superior to both. However, until we examine the likely partisan
effects of these four plans we are not in a position to conclusively
rule out the possibility that one or more of the remedial plans is a
"*stealth gerrymander*\". As is now well recognized, gerrymandering can
be found even in plans with compact appearing districts, or in a plan
with districts that preserve most county borders.

To give a more intuitive feel for how egregiously ill-compact the 2011
map is compared to the other alternatives we are considering, we show
all four maps in the same scale, in a gray and white format. What is
visually apparent from these maps is how aesthetically "ugly\" the 2011
map is compared to all of its alternatives. But it also clear that three
remedy maps that are similar in having relatively few county cuts
nonetheless can look quite different in terms of how each configures
districts.[^18]

\tabnotes{Maps a drawn with a Mercator projection. Shapefiles were obtained from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court website for the four government plans.}
Now we turn to a consideration of probable partisan consequences of the
four maps. We begin with a discussion of the 2011 map.

### Partisan results in actual elections held under the 2011 map {#partisan-results-in-actual-elections-held-under-the-2011-map .unnumbered .unnumbered}

The best evidence about a plan's partisan consequences is, of course,
evidence derived from actual elections under the plan -- if there are
any -- though we do need to check if there are highly anomalous aspects
to one or more of these elections which would make results from them
hard to generalize. Also, the existence of incumbency advantage can have
a distorting effect on the translation of votes into seats, since
incumbents may deter strong challengers, thus reducing the vote-share of
the minority party. Nonetheless, simply from examining outcomes in the
three elections held under the plan (2012, 2014, 2016), the claim that
the 2011 Pennsylvania congressional plan is an egregious partisan
gerrymander is very hard to refute since (a) regardless of voter
preferences the plan returned 13 Republicans and 5 Democrats, with no
district changing hands over the course of the three elections, and (b)
in those three elections, Democrats won only 28% of the seats (5 out of
18), despite winning a substantial share of the vote in all three
elections, with an actual majority of the vote in 2012. In 2012, the
Republican share of the average two-party vote in the congressional
elections in Pennsylvania was 51.1%, in 2014 it was 55.5%, and in 2016
it was 54.2%.[^19]

But there are other indicators of statewide partisan gerrymandering that
also provide a compelling picture of the 2011 map as an (enduring)
partisan gerrymander.

Asymmetry measures for partisan outcomes in the 2011 Plan based on statewide election outcomes {#asymmetry-measures-for-partisan-outcomes-in-the-2011-plan-based-on-statewide-election-outcomes .unnumbered .unnumbered}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several metrics that have been proposed to look at the degree
to which there is asymmetry in seats-votes relationships that might be
indicative of partisan gerrymandering: (1) *partisan bias* [@Tufte1973],
(2) the *mean-minus-median* gap [@Mcdonald_Best_2015_ELJ] (3) the
*efficiency gap* [@Stephanopoulos2014_UofChicagoLaw], and most recently
(4) declination [@Warrington2018]. Each of these measures can be
directly calculated for the 2011 map based on district election
outcomes.[^20]

### Partisan Bias {#partisan-bias .unnumbered .unnumbered}

*Partisan Bias* indicates asymmetry in the translation of each party's
votes into seats. Customarily, partisan bias is measured at the
(hypothetical) point where each party's share of the two-party vote is
exactly 50%. At that point, both parties should, by symmetry, receive
identical seats shares. Thus, the difference between a party's projected
seat-share with 50% of the vote and 0.50 can be taken as a measure of
partisan bias. Note, however, that a partisan bias of zero does not
imply proportional representational. What partisan bias taps is
differential treatment of the parties. Thus, for example, if party R
gets 56% of the seats with 52% of the vote, this is not a sign of bias
as long as party L also can be expected to get 56% of the seats were it
to have 52% of the vote.[^21]

There are a number of different ways to estimate partisan bias based on
the shape of the votes to seats distribution
[@Tufte1973; @Grofman1983; @Browning_King_1987_seats_votes; @GelmanKing1994_unifiedAJPS; @Grofman_et_al_1997_SwingRatio_Bias; @Zingher2016_bias_swingratio_JEPP].
The method we use here is basically that of @Tufte1973 with some
additional complexity building in ideas of @GelmanKing1994_unifiedAJPS
on simulating potential outcomes in a probabalistic fashion.
Hypothetical elections are constructed by incrementally adding (or
subtracting) one percentage point to find aggregate seat outcomes under
differing mean vote shares. The resulting ($s$, $v$) points on the
votes-to-seats curve are then converted to a log odds form by using
$log(\frac{s}{1-s})$ as the dependent variable, and $log(\frac{v}{1-v})$
as the independent variable. A regression on the transformed variables
is then run, with transformed $s$ as the dependent variable, for $v$
values in some range near a 50% vote share. Most often this range is
between a 45% and a 55% vote percentage. *Partisan Bias* is then
calculated from the intercept of this regression using an exponential
transformation (for details see @Grofman1983). Partisan bias is
calculated from the Republican perspective, so a negative sign indicates
bias against Democrats.[^22]

### Mean-Median Gap {#mean-median-gap .unnumbered .unnumbered}

When districts are sorted according to two-party vote share, the
*Mean-Median Gap* is the difference between the average vote percentage
for a party and its vote share in the median district [see @Best2018].
This measure is a variant of *skewness*, such that when the mean is
substantially higher or lower than the median, this is taken to be
indicative of partisan bias.

### Efficiency Gap {#efficiency-gap .unnumbered .unnumbered}

The *Efficiency Gap* is calculated as defined in
@Stephanopoulos2014_UofChicagoLaw, where all the party's votes are
wasted if they lose the district, and all the winner's votes over 50%
are wasted. The difference between each party's wasted votes is then
divided by the total votes cast to produce the *Efficiency Gap*, with a
value of zero denoting what is regarded as ideal. As noted in @Best2018
[p. 13], this is equivalent to taking an aggregate responsiveness (swing
ratio) of two as ideal.

### Declination {#declination .unnumbered .unnumbered}

Among the more recent measures of gerrymandering is the declination.
Declination is an astronomical term referring to the angle on a compass,
with a Latin root meaning "a bending away\". For gerrymandering, it uses
the angles created from ordering all of the districts by vote share,
computing the mean vote-share for each party separately for the seats
they won, and then comparing the differences in their distribution. To
compare, a line is draw from the mean vote-share to the 0.5 line
separately for each party. The angle formed from the different slopes of
the line is called the declination. An angle indicates whether a plan is
a gerrymandering, under the logic that vote-shares should be distributed
in some uniform manner across districts. If partisan are *packed*, the
angle will be greater. All values range between -1 and 1. Since we have
defined the vote-share in terms of Republican outcomes, positive values
are favorable to the Democrats. Further information can be found in
@Warrington2018.

We show in Table [\[tab:congsum\]](#tab:congsum){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:congsum"} the results for the plan found
unconstitutional. Results of the four measures for the plan are based on
using the average of actual congressional results for the 2012-16 period
for the 2011 map.

In our view, none of these measures, standing alone, can be taken to be
proof of gerrymandering. Rather we see them as potentially reinforcing
indicators. Our own analyses have found hypothetical where these
measures can generate either a false positive or a false negative, but
we have also found that consistent bias in the same direction is
unlikely when we use multiple indicators (data omitted for space
reasons). Here, however, all four indicators, like the actual election
results, point clearly and overwhelmingly in the same direction.
Moreover, we see that each of these measures indicates a very
considerable degree of pro-Republican bias.

But we would also emphasize that a partisan gerrymandering claim based
on political consequences should also provide evidence that the
gerrymandering indicators that are found cannot be explained simply by
the geographic distribution of each party's electoral support (e.g.,
differential concentration of electoral support can lead to what has
been called a "natural gerrymander\"), and that the partisan asymmetry
in translating votes into seats is not due to chance alone (e.g., many
highly competitive seats won by very narrow margins) but can be expected
to be durable. With only 18 districts, sensitivity to chance effects is
particularly important. Rebuttal of the claims that the partisan
asymmetries observed in the consistent outcomes of the 2011 map can be
attributed primarily to differential concentration of party voting
strengths, or to chance, is given in the expert witness testimony in the
case (see esp. the simulations of potential good government maps done by
Professor Chen, discussed in detail in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
opinion in the case, and on which the Court placed great reliance). With
respect to the durability of the effects of the 2011 map, we have
already pointed out that this plan yielded unchanged 13R-5D results for
three elections in a row. But we would add the explanation that the 2011
Map has primarily safe seats (13 of 18 with greater than 10% margin).
But, indicative of the pro-Republican gerrymander achieved with the 2011
map, those safe seats are distributed in a highly asymmetric fashion,
with nine safe seats for Republicans and only four for Democrats.[^23]

Projecting Partisan Outcomes from Statewide Results {#projecting-partisan-outcomes-from-statewide-results .unnumbered .unnumbered}
---------------------------------------------------

In order to assess expected partisan consequences for plans that have
not yet been implemented we need to develop a predictive equation, and
that is most readily done with data on partisan outcomes for state-wide
elections projected into the new districts. For example, Professor Jowei
Chen in his testimony in the Pennsylvania case used the six state-wide
elections between 2008 and 2010 for prediction. After extensive
investigation of alternative prediction models and their accuracy in
reproducing the partisan outcomes of the 2012, 2104, and 2016
congressional elections at the district level (data omitted for space
reasons), we have opted for a model that takes the average of five 2016
elections that reflect a balance of Republican and Democratic success:
President, U.S. Senate, PA Attorney General, PA Treasurer, and PA
Auditor. Republicans won the statewide vote in two of them (President,
U.S. Senate), while the Democrats won the statewide vote in three of
them (Auditor, Treasurer, and Attorney General).[^24]

To simplify the exposition, we report the Republican share of the
two-party vote ($\delta_{i}$). Districting plans are represented by
$\mathcal D$, (e.g., $\mathcal D_{enacted}$, $\mathcal D_{remedial}$,
..., $\mathcal D_{j}$), and each election in year $y$ has a district
vote distribution
$\Delta_{y} = [\delta_{y1}, \delta_{y2}, \dots, \delta_{yi}]$. To find
the overall state-wide vote, we calculate the average district vote
share,
$\bar{\Delta}_{\mathcal D y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{yi}$.
By averaging, we reduce the influence of turnout variation between
districts,. This average is a useful state-wide estimate of voter
sentiment [see e.g. @Kastellec_et_al_2008_PS].

We begin by providing summary statistics on the *actual* state-wide vote
shares in the years 2006 to 2018 for the actual congressional vote (see
Table [\[tab:congsum\]](#tab:congsum){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:congsum"}).[^25] We include the calculated measures of
gerrymandering and the seat-share distribution for each of the years.
Years 2004 to 2010 are results under the enacted map of 2001, 2012 to
2016 for the 2011 map ultimately found unconstitutional, and the 2018
results are that held under the court remedial map of 20118. Further, in
appendix Table
[\[tab:districtvotes\]](#tab:districtvotes){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:districtvotes"} lists the individual district vote-shares
($\Delta_{2016} = [{\delta_{1}, \delta_{2}, \dots, \delta_{i}}]$) for
each of the five component elections for our composite, and the
composite average for the 2016 election from which the results below

We now need to validate that using state-wide elections instead of
previous congressional elections for evaluating gerrymandering effects
is a reasonable choice.[^26] Past congressional results alone often are
departures from the underlying district partisanship several reasons.
The vote share of an incumbent has historically been greater than it is
for a non-incumbent or two non-incumbents running for an open seat.[^27]
A well-financed incumbent tends to suppress quality competition
[@Jacobson2015_JOP], vulnerable incumbents who can sense the political
winds opt against running for re-election
[@Jacobson_Kernell_1981; @Ansolabehere_Snyder_2004_LSQ], and electoral
tides and varying turnout can distort the state-wide average. Midterm
elections often have vastly different electorates than presidential
elections [@Abramowitz_et_al_1986_AJPS], while the midterm pattern of
"surge and decline\" (what goes up must come down principle) reduces the
sitting Presidents' party's vote share [@CampbellA1960].

What we are after is a measure of the "normal vote". The normal vote is
the underlying partisanship of a district [@Converse1966]. It is sort of
a mystical number since it is uncovered and unobserved, but powerful
theoretically. Map builders implicitly assume a normal vote when
constructing a district plan. We believe that state-wide elections offer
the most useful approximation of the normal vote.[^28] All districts
vote on the same candidates, hence outcome affects all voters equally.
The effects of incumbency can distort the vote in congressional races in
a way that doesn't resemble the actual partisan preferences at the
district-level. State-wide elections eliminate the need to impute or
otherwise deal with uncontested districts. Taking an average of the
state-wide elections provides additional reason to believe it's
capturing a normal vote due to a regression to the mean effects.
Justices in *Vieth* offered skepticism in using elections that have
contrasting results; we do not share this view, instead seeing it as an
important source of variation that helps to recognize the underlying
partisanship in which *should* be used in measuring bias in districting
plans. Additionally, averaging over multiple races and years helps to
reduce the bias imposed by candidate effects.

We construct the five-election composite of state-wide elections by
aggregating voting district level (precincts) data to the congressional
district level.[^29] Encouragingly, our five-election composite results
in the same 13R-5D result that the 2016 congressional races
delivered.[^30] Additionally, each district's outcome is identical to
the 2016 congressional district results. Indeed, after accounting for
incumbency, our composite measure is remarkably accurate in it's
predictions of the actual congressional results validating our measure.
The average difference between our composite and the congressional
results was just 2.16%. We calculate this average only for districts
contested in 2016, since uncontested results have significant
deviations. Including the uncontested districts increases this mean
difference to just 3.93%. We believe our composite measure offers better
representation of the true partisanship in these districts.
Individually, only the Auditor's race correctly predicts all the
districts correctly, but by either summing or by taking the average of
the five races, both methods correctly predict each district's outcome.
We imputed the values 25% and 75% for uncontested or essentially
uncontested races. Rather than taking the projected outcome we arrive at
from this method as a single value, we looked at the sensitivity of this
projection to the empirical range of inter-election swing, simulating
outcomes 1,000 times. To arrive at our estimate for inter-election
variation that can't be attributed to the normal vote or incumbency
advantage, we estimate the equation using congressional elections in
Pennsylvania in the 2004-16 time period: $$\begin{aligned}
				\mathrm{Vote}_{ty} = \alpha + \beta_{1} \mathrm{Vote}_{yt-1} + \beta_{2} \mathrm{Incumbency}_{yt} + \beta_{4} \mathrm{Uncontestedness}_y{t} + \epsilon
				\end{aligned}$$ We are interested in $\epsilon$, which is the
unexplained variance, which includes inter-election swing. We run this
equation separately for each of the non-redistricting years and then
average the coefficients. We estimate incumbency advantage to average
4.27% for this time period, while inter-election variance is 4.46%. When
simulating elections, we use the composite as the normal vote, but add
in for each district a random draw from a normal distribution centered
at the district vote with a standard deviation of $\epsilon$. We can
then calculate statistics for each of these simulated elections to find
a distribution for each measure of gerrymandering.

Table [\[tab:gerry\]](#tab:gerry){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:gerry"} reports the same four measures of partisan
effects found in Table
[\[tab:congsum\]](#tab:congsum){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:congsum"} but now for all four maps, using the projected
statewide vote from our five-election composite, under the methodology
described above. We also provide a measure of variability to show what
range of reasonable outcomes for each of the plans and identify when
gerrymandering effects are persistent.

	: Measures of Gerrymandering for the Four Considered
	Plans[]{label="tab:gerry"}

\tabnotes{Measures are averages of 1,000 simulations for each map using the 2016 composite. Brackets numbers are the 95\% range.}
Our confidence in our five election projection method is buttressed
because, when we applied this method to predict the results of the 2018
election under the court-ordered remedial map, although the method had
been developed prior to the 2018 election, using data no more recent
than 2016, it correctly predicted that the court-ordered remedial map
would generate an outcome of 9R-9D.[^31]

The findings from Table [\[tab:gerry\]](#tab:gerry){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:gerry"} are very clear! Regardless of which metric we
examine, the 2011 map is the most gerrymandered. Not surprisingly, the
nature of the bias is in a pro-Republican direction. Given the
cumulative weight of all the evidence, the 2011 congressional map was
clearly an egregious pro-Republican gerrymander. In contrast, as we
might expect, the court-ordered plan, prepared by a respected expert
whose instructions were to satisfy good government criteria, was by a
considerable margin the closest to a perfectly neutral plan in partisan
terms according to all four measures.

As we might also expect, again according to all four measures, the next
most gerrymandered map -- also in a pro-Republican direction -- is the
*Joint Legislative* plan offered by Republican legislative leaders as a
remedy plan. The partisan gerrymandering indicators for this plan are
sufficiently close to those of the 2011 map, and sufficiently far from
those of the court-ordered map, that we believe it appropriate to label
this plan as a "*stealth gerrymander*\" since it achieves partisan
purposes while (mostly) providing the visual appearance of a good
government map (see [\[fig:maps\]](#fig:maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:maps"}).

However, having labeled the Joint Legislative plan a *stealth
gerrymander*, it is worth reminding readers that, had this plan been the
original plan adopted by Republicans, it is very much an open question
as to whether it would have been rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. Even though, in partisan terms, it is nearly identical to the
2011 plan, it is considerably more consistent with good government
criteria (see Table
[\[tab:summaries\]](#tab:summaries){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:summaries"}) -- not that much worse than the Court
Remedial plan -- that it would have required detailed political election
analyses like those we have done here to demonstrate its *stealth
gerrymander* features, plus a court willing to rule specifically on
grounds that it was a *partisan gerrymander*.

Because the Joint Legislative plan was not passed by the State of
Pennsylvania legislature, the Court felt no need for particular
deference to it (or to the Governor's plan, for that matter). Thus, the
Court was not bound by the normal supposition with respect to
districting that a plan authorized by the state need not be the "best
possible,\" but only unconstitutional. That "deference\" to legislative
judgments and the criteria they reflect, might well have tipped the
balance toward acceptance of the Joint Legislative plan were it offered
as having been fully sanctioned by the State of Pennsylvania (the duly
elected legislature and Governor).[^32]

On the other hand, in the presence of this *stealth gerrymander* rather
than the blatant gerrymander that came before it, the Pennsylvania Court
might well have relied on partisan impact evidence to reach a conclusion
of unconstitutionality. The language of the Final Order implementing the
Court's own plan strongly suggests this possibility. There, the Court
said about the 2011 plan that it

> "was designed to dilute the votes of those who in prior elections
> voted for the party not in power in order to give the party in power a
> lasting electoral advantage. In stark contrast, Article I, Section 5
> of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides: 'Elections shall be free
> and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time
> interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.' Pa.
> Const. art. I, § 5. On this record, it is clear that the 2011 Plan
> violates Article I, Section 5, since a diluted vote is not an equal
> vote\" (slip op. p. 2).

Finally, we turn to the plan offered by the Democratic governor,
Governor Wolf. To our surprise, this plan turned out also to have a
pro-Republican tilt, nearly to the same extent as the Joint Legislative
plan for three of the four metrics in Table
[\[tab:gerry\]](#tab:gerry){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:gerry"}.
This puzzling finding suggests that the Governor might have been under
pressure from Democratic incumbents not to reduce their expected vote
margins, or that he sincerely intended it to be a compromise that the
Republican legislature might agree to. However, there is one important
difference between the Joint plan and that of the Governor: among the
seven districts likely to be won by Democrats, the Democratic
percentages are cut more narrowly in the Republican plan than in the
Governor's plan in three of the districts so that, in a good Republican
year, Republicans will do better under their plan than under the
Democratic plan.

Still, when we look at Table
[\[tab:gerry\]](#tab:gerry){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:gerry"}
we are struck by the fact that all four plans, even the Court-ordered
one, still appear to have some level -- very slight in one case, extreme
in others -- of pro-Republican bias. In the next section we consider why
this might have happened, and we introduce a potentially important
distinction between "*neutral plans*\" and "*fair plans*.\"

Natural Gerrymanders {#natural-gerrymanders .unnumbered .unnumbered}
--------------------

In 2018, even under a court-drawn plan, in a year when Democrats had won
a clear majority of the aggregate two-party congressional vote,
Democrats only succeeded in winning exactly 50% of the seats. Trying to
understand why all four of the plans we considered had some level of
pro-Republican bias requires us to look in more detail at the partisan
electoral geography of Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, Philadelphia is
overwhelmingly Democratic in voting. In particular, if you draw two
congressional districts entirely within Philadelphia County, one of them
is very likely to give Democratic candidates around 90% of the vote, and
for sure, as long as both are wholly within the County, the average vote
in the two will be around 80% Democratic no matter how you draw the two
districts. There are no other large, concentrated pockets of
equivalently overwhelmingly Republican voting strength. Thus, more
Democratic votes will *naturally* be "wasted\" in Philadelphia than
Republican votes will be "wasted\" elsewhere in the state. Additionally,
the city of Philadelphia is landlocked, and its position on the state's
border reduces the ability of line drawers who favor Democrats to
distribute these voters into multiple districts so as to minimize the
extent to which Democratic votes in the county are wasted. Additional
Democratic wasted votes come in heavily Democratic Allegheny County, the
county in which the city of Pittsburgh is located. However, saying that
urban concentration of Democrats means that it is harder for Democrats
to turn their votes into seats than is the case for Republicans does not
mean that we cannot distinguish the effects of such *natural*
gerrymanders from *intentional* political gerrymandering, since the
latter generates perverse consequences for Democratic voters to a far
greater extent than the likely one district penalty created by the
nature of Pennsylvania's present electoral geography.[^33] In the first
set of 500 simulations in his expert witness report, based only on
traditional redistricting criteria, but not including voting rights
protections, Professor Chen found that none resulted in the 13R-5D split
as happened in 2012 and subsequent years. The mode was 9R-9D.[^34]

Recognizing the potential for so-called "*natural* gerrymandering\", we
wish to highlight a potentially important distinction between *neutral*
plans and *fair* plans -- each of which reflects a different approach to
defining the baseline for what constitutes gerrymandering. Neutral plans
refer to those that are drawn entirely with respect to traditional good
government criteria, with no attention paid to partisan considerations.
One way to define partisan gerrymandering is with respect to a baseline
defined by the set of feasible neutral plans -- and this was how one of
the plaintiff's experts in the Pennsylvania case, Professor Jowei Chen
[cf. @Chen2013] shaped his testimony in the Pennsylvania case, and in
other cases in which he has testified.[^35] In contrast, we may wish to
use the term fair plans as ones that seek to compensate for the
difference in partisan concentration,. Fair plans seek to achieve a
partisan balance of 50-50 when the aggregate vote-shares of each party's
candidates are equal to one another. A fair plan would also be one that
is symmetric at points beyond 50-50, such that when party R wins 70% of
the districts with 55% of the vote, party L can similarly win 70% of the
districts with 55% of the vote.

One clear finding of our analysis of the court-ordered map is that it
was drawn as a "neutral map\", though not necessarily a fair map in the
sense we are using the term above. In order to create a truly "fair
map\", it would have been necessary to break up Philadelphia County in
more than three pieces so as to avoid packing Democratic voters. But the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court opted not to do that, but to preserve county
lines and draw a good government map.

Conclusions and Lessons for the future; The Potential Impact of LWV
===================================================================

While the Pennsylvania court opinion is limited to Pennsylvania, and
thus it might have seemed of importance only in Pennsylvania, in
footnote 71 of the Opinion (slip op. pp.116-117), the court took what we
regard as a rather unusual step. It issued what can only be called an
invitation to other state courts to use the same logic it used to
invalidate partisan gerrymanders in their own state. As we noted
earlier, the Court pointed out that there are twelve states whose
constitutions contain election clauses identical to the Pennsylvania
charter, requiring elections to be "free and equal": Arizona, Arkansas,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Oregon,
Tennessee, Washington, and Wyoming.[^36]

\tabnotes{Seats and votes are based on the 2016 five-election projection (to deal with the existence of non-contested congressional districts). Percentages are of the of district level results. This difference is why the percentages reported in columns 6 and 8 are not identical. Data from DailyKos, All about Redistricting, and Ballotpedia web sites.States with fewer than 9 districts do not have efficiency gap or median values reported because of the potential unreliability of those calculations given the small number of districts involved.}
Only a handful of these states are ripe for partisan gerrymandering
challenges -- in that (ca. 2017) three lack unified party control of the
state, two are single district states, and some already have a
commission drawing plans and, in others, *indicia* of gerrymandering are
missing. We show in Table
[\[tab:states\_compare\]](#tab:states_compare){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:states_compare"} information that can help us form
beliefs about whether or not the congressional plans in these dozen
states are partisan gerrymanders. However, as pointed out in the table
notes, some measures are not well suited for calculation when the seats
at issue are few in number.

In looking to the future, we should also note that some states that are
generally regarded as among the most pernicious partisan gerrymanders,
Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin are not included among the
twelve, nor is Maryland. On the other hand, we should also note that a
"free and equal" elections clause is not the only avenue state courts
might use to attack partisan gerrymanders in the future. As University
of Kentucky College of Law Professor Joshua Douglas has pointed out,
virtually every state constitution protects voting rights more
explicitly than the U.S. Constitution does. In addition to the thirteen
states that require elections to be "free and equal", an additional
thirteen have state constitutional provisions that require elections to
be "free and open", and this clause could, in principle, be used in
exactly the same way as the "free and equal" clause.[^37] Such a clause
is found in a number of the states widely regarded as having the worst
congressional gerrymandering. Additionally, other citizen-based reforms
such as referendum and initiatives are recognized as potential solutions
to egregious gerrymandering. Some have called to turn away from the
federal judiciary altogether and instead focus on state-level litigation
[@Wang_et_al_2019_Labortories_UPJCL]. We believe that the *LWV* decision
and the further comparative analyses of alternative plans presented in
the previous section of this paper will help other state courts navigate
their way to decisions that strike down some partisan gerrymanders as
unconstitutional, while allowing others to remain in place on the
grounds that either they are not that severe, or they are unlikely to be
lasting in that they have sufficiently many competitive seats as to be
responsive to changes in voting patterns.

[^4]: Avoiding fragmentation of communities of interest is also
		sometimes included in this list.

[^5]: The trial court considered a variety of factors offered in expert
		witness testimony, including evidence about the map's political
		impact. The trial court's findings of fact reveal that the 2011 map
		exhibited clearly a multiplicity of indicia of partisan
		gerrymandering. In his review, the trial judge found, in essence,
		that the legislative process through which the plan had been chosen
		demonstrated the indicia of a partisan gerrymander, that the weird
		shapes of a number of the districts demonstrated the indicia of a
		partisan gerrymander, that the dismemberment of municipalities,
		townships and counties in the state demonstrated the indicia of a
		partisan gerrymander, that the cracking and packing of
		Democrat-leaning voters demonstrated the indicia of a partisan
		gerrymander, and that the frozen 13R-5D results over the course of
		three elections in a state that is highly politically competitive
		statewide demonstrated the indicia of a partisan gerrymander. And
		the trial judge also found that none of these features of the map
		could be explained as necessitated by the electoral geography and
		demography of the state, though he suggested the possibility that
		consideration such as incumbency protection might have mattered.
		However, the trial court then, rather regretfully, concluded that it
		did not have a legal basis to declare the plan unconstitutional
		under either the Pennsylvania State Constitution or under then
		existing federal law precedents. Instead, it expressed a pious hope
		that the U.S. Supreme Court, in its review of the appeals of lower
		court cases, such as the 2017 case of [*Gill v. Whitford 585 U. S.
		\_\_\_
		(2018)*.](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/16-1161_Opinion.pdf),
		which had overturned as a partisan gerrymander a Wisconsin
		legislative map, would finally adopt a (manageable) standard for
		identifying unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering that all courts
		could apply. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, for all practical
		purposes, adopted in *toto* the factual finding of the trial court
		magistrate, Judge Brobson, but came to a diametrically opposite
		legal conclusion about the constitutionality of the congressional
		plan and the legal grounding for that finding.

[^6]: Pennsylvania Supreme Court Judges are elected or retained to
		ten-year terms in elections with party labels on the ballot. Judges
		with Democratic affiliations now constitute the majority of the
		Court In 2011 this was not the case.

[^7]: On March 20, 2018, Rep. Cris Dush, of Jefferson County introduced
		a measure that would impeach the four Democratic members of the
		court that voted to replace the map. His argument is that the
		members of the court overstepped their rights and violated the
		Separation of Powers principle of the state. Others saw this as
		simply sour grapes:\
		["Pennsylvania Republicans lost the redistricting battle. Now,
		they're declaring war on the courts\", https://wapo.st/2LlEVvE

[^8]: The *Gill* remand decision still leaves open the question that has
		haunted opponents of partisan gerrymandering for the last thirty
		plus years, namely 'When, if ever, will the U.S. Supreme Court
		actually declare a redistricting map unconstitutional?'. The
		potential for such a finding of unconstitutionality is laid out in
		*Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986)*, which declared partisan
		gerrymandering justiciable, but under which the Supreme Court has
		never yet (as of May 2019) struck down a plan as an unconstitutional
		partisan gerrymander. Despite the 7-2 decision on the Wisconsin
		remand, which rejected the view that the Court should simply bow out
		of the process of reviewing maps as possible unconstitutional
		partisan gerrymanders, the retirement of Justice Kennedy and his
		expected replacement by a more conservative Justice creates even
		greater uncertainty about whether, in the lifetime of the present
		authors, there will ever be a U.S. Supreme Court majority that
		rejects some challenged district as an unconstitutional partisan
		gerrymander. We will, relatively soon, have the answer to that
		question due to the inevitable appeals of partisan gerrymandering
		cases from North Carolina and Maryland that have already had oral
		argument on March 26, 2019 before the U.S. Supreme Court (*Rucho,
		et. al*. v. *Common Cause, et. al* \[1:16-CV-1026\]) and *Lamone,
		et. al.* v. *Benisek, et. al.* \[1:13-cv-03233-JKB\]), with
		decisions expected in June 2019. In addition, there is a partisan
		gerrymandering challenge in Michigan, *League of Women Voters of
		Michigan* v. *Johnson* that will certainly be appealed to the U S.
		Supreme Court, as will the next lower court decision in *Gill*
		itself.

[^9]: Indeed, if the Supreme Court continues to dodge any responsibility
		for checking egregious partisan gerrymandering, *LWV* may well prove
		to be the most important partisan gerrymandering decision ever
		[@Grofman_Cervas_2018_ELJ].

[^14]: Given the U.S. Supreme Court's remand of the Gill case, it
		appears that any federal standard would need to be district
		specific.

[^15]: There is a debate about how to count split counties, which was
		evident when different parties in the case counted different total
		splits for the same plans. One way to count splits to to count the
		total number of counties that are in at least two districts. The
		other way is to count the number of times a county is split, ie, the
		number of non-contiguous pieces of county. In principle, a county
		can be split into 18 different districts but only counted as one
		split, but in the latter it would be counted as 18 splits. The court
		wasn't clear on which criteria they would rely, and because of the
		implications, a future court should make clear which principle map
		makers should prioritize.

[^16]: We find counties that are split into multiple pieces particularly
		egregious. "*Fracking*\" occurs when one district is split into two
		or more non-contiguous pieces of a single county. It was not
		mentioned in the the *LWV* decision, but too can be used as an
		indicia of partisan (and racial) manipulation. We call this
		"*fracking*\" to parallel the terminology of other districting terms
		of "*cracking*\" and "*packing*\". Examples of "fracking\" in the
		2011 enacted map include districts 14 & 18 in Alleghany County
		(Pittsburgh).

[^17]: $A_D$ = area of district, $P_D$= perimeter of district,
		$Circle_D$= minimum circumscribing circle;\
		*POLSBYPOPPER* = $\frac{4 \pi A_D}{{P_{D}}^{2}}$ *REOCK* =
		$\frac{A_D}{A(Circle_D)}$

[^18]: This latter point is reinforced if we examine good government
		maps prepared by
		[DailyKos](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/2/8/1739648/-Pennsylvania-will-soon-redraw-its-House-map-to-end-GOP-gerrymandering-How-would-you-draw-the-lines)
		and by the present authors (available upon request).

[^19]: For consistency, we report the average vote share after imputing
		0.25 and 0.75 for uncontested districts.

[^20]: Another recently proposed measure is a simplified version of
		partisan bias which lacks the advantage of separately calculating
		bias and responsiveness (swing ratio). It is calculated by taking
		the average two-party vote for the dominant party and adjusting it
		uniformly downward in each district so that the two parties receive
		exactly 50% of the overall vote; then we look to see how far the
		seat share the dominant party now receives is from 50%
		[@Wang2016_SLR]

[^21]: Although the basic idea goes back at least as far as @Dahl1956,
		the modern *locus classicus* in political science for the idea of
		partisan bias(and the parallel concept of responsiveness/swing
		ratio) is @Tufte1973, with important recent work done by Gary King
		(see e.g., [@GelmanKing1994_unifiedAJPS]; and review in
		@GrofmanKing2007). A closely related line of research is found in
		the political geography literature (with *locus classicus*
		@Brookes1959 [@Brookes1960] -- with some further methodological
		improvements by scholars such as @Johnston1994 [@Rossiter1997] and
		@Johnston2002.

[^22]: Where to center the seats/votes curve and measure bias is an
		unresolved dilemma in the literature [@Kastellec_et_al_2008_PS]. In
		@GelmanKing1994_unifiedAJPS's `JudgeIt` program, the choice is to
		center the election at the average Democratic vote share. We've run
		the numbers in three ways, the aforementioned way, centering at a
		tied 50/50 election, and at the actual election results. All three
		variations provide similar estimates, as do the results from
		`JudgeIt`. To ensure the robustness of our estimates of bias, we
		adapted the code from @Kastellec_et_al_2008_PS and fit the data on
		the actual congressional election results and obtained similar
		magnitudes on the coefficients. The method used in that paper
		parallels that used by `JudgeIt`, which instead of simply using a
		uniform swing assumption, models inter-election swings and adjusts
		for overtime differences in vote shares among and between districts,
		and does this 1000 times for each level of uniform swing between 45
		and 55% average vote share. This method is expected to give similar,
		although not exactly the same results. Readers should noting that
		with only 18 districts, analysis of bias might not be appropriate
		[@Browning_King_1987_seats_votes]. While readers shouldn't put too
		much weight on the individual bias coefficients, we note importantly
		that the bias is in the expected direct, and the relative
		differences between plans are congruent with the other measures. The
		same caution is urged for all the measures of gerrymandering
		reported in this essay.

[^23]: Moreover, we should note that some authors [e.g.,
		@Grofman2019_ELJ forthcoming] have argued that a partisan
		gerrymandering claim at a jurisdiction-wide level must also be
		reinforced by district specific evidence of manipulation of
		particular district boundaries. As noted earlier, we do not discuss
		this type of district-specific evidence here, other than to point
		out that such evidence was presented at the trial leading to the
		finding that the Pennsylvania congressional map was an
		unconstitutional gerrymander under Pennsylvania state law.

[^24]: We compiled the composite measure using both the sum of the raw
		votes by party and an average of the two-party vote in the five
		races at the district level. Both ways result in the same district
		partisanship breakdowns in all plans.

[^25]: The only adjustment we make is to impute the values 0.25 and 0.75
		for uncontested or nearly uncontested elections.

[^26]: We can only validate our measure for the 2016 election and only
		for the 2011 enacted plan. For all the remedial plans we are
		analysing, the composite is our "best guess\". We have to make some
		assumptions about state and district inter-election swings. For
		simplicity, we assume that all districts have a national shift equal
		to the state-level swing, ie, difference from the 2016 elections.
		Later in the paper, we conduct simulated elections that vary the
		district level variability.

[^27]: A long literature in political science has evaluated and
		confirmed the presence and increased incumbency advantage
		[@Abramowitz1991; @Levitt1997; @Ansolabehere2002b; @Gelman_Huang_2008].
		Recent scholarship, however, has shown a decrease in the advantage
		towards zero [@Jacobson2015_JOP].

[^28]: We particularly believe this is true when the votes between
		elections are highly correlated and the district-level variation is
		low, as it was in Pennsylvania from 2012 to 2016. The more stable
		the electorate is, the more confidence we have that state-wide
		elections are revealing the normal vote
		[@Ansolabehere_et_al_2000_AJPS].

[^29]: We wrote a function in R to assign all VTDs to a district based
		on the centroid of the VTD. This method creates a slight difference
		between it and the actual vote, but averages just -0.06% per
		district. Most of the mis-allocation is between two adjacent
		districts, District 1 and District 13, both overwhelmingly
		Democratic districts.

[^30]: Whether we take the sum of the five elections or average the five
		elections, both methods deliver the same relative distributions.

[^31]: Because of its high number of competitive seats, a point
		prediction such as 9R-9D is somewhat misleading for the
		court-ordered map. Using the five-election model as our predictor,
		there are fewer safe Democratic seats (5) than safe Republican seats
		(7) in the Court plan, using 45%-55% definition of a competitive
		seat. This is one fewer safe seat for Republicans and one additional
		safe Democratic seat than is found in the 2011 plan, but the Court
		plan also has five districts balanced on a knife edge, with a
		projected winner's margin under two percentage points, making it
		highly responsive to shifting voter sentiment. This is realized in
		our simulations where the mean seat share, though near 9R-9D, is
		either lower or higher depending on where the state-wide vote is
		centered.

[^32]: The Court picked the plan among those before it that most closely
		satisfied good government criteria -- which happily, thanks to
		Professor Persily's expertise as consultant to the Court, turned out
		to be its own plan, and thus a plan which the Court could know with
		certainty was not intended as a partisan gerrymander for either
		party. Whether it would have still sought to maximize compliance
		with good government criteria had the plan which did so been a
		"*stealth gerrymander*\" is not a question we can answer.

[^33]: @Chen2013 estimate this bias as about 1.45 seats (8%) but Chen's
		expert witness testimony in the Pennsylvania cases generates a lower
		estimate of natural bias until one builds in the need to protect
		minority opportunity districts.

[^35]: Similarly, @Grofman2018_ELJ asserts that "Gerrymandering occurs
		when a districting plan creates a disparate treatment of the vote
		share of the minority and majority voting blocs in a way that
		penalizes the minority in its ability to translate its voting
		support into seats compared to what we might expect from a plan
		drawn on the basis of neutral principles.\"

[^36]: In its Opinion, the Court provided specific citations to each of
		these provisions which we have not reproduced.
